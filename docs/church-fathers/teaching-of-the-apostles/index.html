Do not even the Gentiles the same? But do ye love them that hate you, and ye shall not have an enemy.</p><p>1:9 Abstain thou from fleshly and bodily lusts.</p><p>1:10 If any man give thee a blow on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also, and thou shalt be perfect;</p><p>1:11 if a man impress thee to go with him, one mile, go with him twain;</p><p>1:12 if a man take away thy cloak, give him thy coat also;</p><p>1:13 if a man take away from thee that which is thine own, ask it not back, for neither art thou able.</p><p>1:14 To every man that asketh of thee give, and ask not back;</p><p>1:15 for the Father desireth that gifts be given to all from His own bounties.</p><p>1:16 Blessed is he that giveth according to the commandment;</p><p>1:17 for he is guiltless.</p><p>1:18 Woe to him that receiveth;</p><p>1:19 for, if a man receiveth having need, he is guiltless;</p><p>1:20 but he that hath no need shall give satisfaction why and wherefore he received;</p><p>1:21 and being put in confinement he shall be examined concerning the deeds that he hath done, and he shall not come out thence until he hath given back the last farthing.</p><p>1:22 Yea, as touching this also it is said;</p><p>1:23 Let thine alms sweat into thine hands, until thou shalt have learnt to whom to give.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="chapter-ii">Chapter II<a href="#chapter-ii" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct

not corrupt boys, thou shalt not commit fornication, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not deal in magic, thou shalt do no sorcery, thou shalt not murder a child by abortion nor kill them when born, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour&#x27;s goods, thou shalt not perjure thyself, thou shalt not bear false witness, thou shalt not speak evil, thou shalt not cherish a grudge, thou shalt not be double-minded nor double-tongued;</p><p>2:3 for the double tongue is a snare of death.</p><p>2:4 Thy word shall not be false or empty, but fulfilled by action.</p><p>2:5 Thou shalt not be avaricious nor a plunderer nor a hypocrite nor ill-tempered nor proud.</p><p>2:6 Thou shalt not entertain an evil design against thy neighbour.</p><p>2:7 Thou shalt not hate any man, but some thou shalt reprove, and for others thou shalt pray, and others thou shalt love more than thy life.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="chapter-iii">Chapter III<a href="#chapter-iii" class="hash-link"

to murder, nor jealous nor contentious nor wrathful;</p><p>3:3 for of all these things murders are engendered.</p><p>3:4 My child, be not lustful, for lust leadeth to fornication, neither foul-speaking neither with uplifted eyes;</p><p>3:5 for of all these things adulteries are engendered.</p><p>3:6 My child, be no dealer in omens, since it leads to idolatry, nor an enchanter nor an astrologer nor a magician, neither be willing to look at them;</p><p>3:7 for from all these things idolatry is engendered.</p><p>3:8 My child, be not a liar, since lying leads to theft, neither avaricious neither vainglorious;</p><p>3:9 for from all these things thefts are engendered.</p><p>3:10 My child, be not a murmurer, since it leadeth to blasphemy, neither self-willed neither a thinker of evil thoughts;</p><p>3:11 for from all these things blasphemies are engendered.</p><p>3:12 But be meek, since the meek shall inherit the earth.</p><p>3:13 Be long-suffering and pitiful and guileless and quiet and kindly and always fearing the words which thou hast heard.</p><p>3:14 Thou shalt not exalt thyself, neither shalt thou admit boldness into thy soul.</p><p>3:15 Thy soul shall not cleave together with the lofty, but with the righteous and humble shalt thou walk.</p><p>3:16 The accidents that befal thee thou shalt receive as good, knowing that nothing is done without God.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="chapter-iv">Chapter IV<a href="#chapter-iv" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Chapter IV" title="Direct link to Chapter

is the Lord.</p><p>4:3 Moreover thou shalt seek out day by day the persons of the saints, that thou mayest find rest in their words.</p><p>4:4 Thou shalt not make a schism, but thou shalt pacify them that contend;</p><p>4:5 thou shalt judge righteously, thou shalt not make a difference in a person to reprove him for transgressions.</p><p>4:6 Thou shalt not doubt whether a thing shall be or not be.</p><p>4:7 Be not thou found holding out thy hands to receive, but drawing them in as to giving.</p><p>4:8 If thou hast ought passing through thy hands, thou shalt give a ransom for thy sins.</p><p>4:9 Thou shalt not hesitate to give, neither shalt thou murmur when giving;</p><p>4:10 for thou shalt know who is the good paymaster of thy reward.</p><p>4:11 Thou shalt not turn away from him that is in want, but shalt make thy brother partaker in all things, and shalt not say that anything is thine own.</p><p>4:12 For if ye are fellow-partakers in that which is imperishable, how much rather in the things which are perishable? Thou shalt not withhold thy hand from thy son or from thy daughter, but from their youth thou shalt teach them the fear of God.</p><p>4:13 Thou shalt not command thy bondservant or thine handmaid in thy bitterness, who trust in the same God as thyself, lest haply they should cease to fear the God who is over both of you;</p><p>4:14 for He cometh, not to call men with respect of persons, but He cometh to those whom the Spirit hath prepared.</p><p>4:15 But ye, servants, shall be subject unto your masters, as to a type of God, in shame and fear.</p><p>®LA1¯4:16 Thou shalt hate all hypocrisy, and everything that is not pleasing to the Lord.</p><p>4:17 Thou shalt never forsake the commandments of the Lord;</p><p>4:18 but shalt keep those things which thou hast received, neither adding to them nor taking away from them.</p><p>4:19 In church thou shalt confess thy transgressions, and shalt not betake thyself to prayer with an evil conscience.</p><p>4:20 This is the way of life.</p><h3

the way of death is this.</p><p>5:2 First of all, it is evil and full of a curse murders, adulteries, lusts, fornications, thefts, idolatries, magical arts, witchcrafts, plunderings, false witnessings, hypocrisies, doubleness of heart, treachery, pride, malice, stubbornness, covetousness, foul-speaking, jealousy, boldness, exaltation, boastfulness;</p><p>5:3 persecutors of good men, hating truth, loving a lie, not perceiving the reward of righteousness, not cleaving to the good nor to righteous judgment, wakeful not for that which is good but for that which is evil;</p><p>5:4 from whom gentleness and forbearance stand aloof;</p><p>5:5 loving vain things, pursuing a recompense, not pitying the poor man, not toiling for him that is oppressed with toil, not recognizing Him that made them, murderers of children, corrupters of the creatures of God, turning away from him that is in want, oppressing him that is afflicted, advocates of the wealthy, unjust judges of the poor,

knowledge of the Lord, receive him as the Lord.</p><p>11:4 But concerning the apostles and prophets, so do ye according to the ordinance of the Gospel.</p><p>11:5 Let every apostle, when he cometh to you, be received as the Lord;</p><p>11:6 but he shall not abide more than a single day, or if there be need, a 11:7 but if he abide three days, he is a false prophet.</p><p>11:8 And when he departeth

otherwise he is a false prophet.</p><p>11:16 And every prophet teaching the truth, if he doeth not what he teacheth, is a false prophet.</p><p>11:17 And every prophet approved and found true, if he doeth ought as an outward mystery typical of the Church, and yet teacheth you not to do all that he himself doeth, shall not be judged before you;</p><p>11:18 he hath his judgment in the presence of God;</p><p>11:19 for in like manner also did the prophets of old time.</p><p>11:20 And whosoever shall say in the Spirit, Give me silver or anything else, ye shall not listen to him;</p><p>11:21 but
