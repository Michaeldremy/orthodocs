# Who is Saint Ignatius?

St. Ignatius of Antioch was a prominent early Christian bishop and martyr who died in 107 AD. He was the bishop of Antioch, Syria (now in Turkey), known mainly from seven highly regarded letters that he wrote during a trip to Rome, as a prisoner condemned to be executed.

### Icon depicting St. Ignatius

In the image he is being devoured by wild beasts, a punishment given by the roman emperor known as Trajan, for saying the following;

> "Thou art in error when thou callest the daemons of the nations gods. For there is but one God, who made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that are in them; and one Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, whose kingdom may I enjoy."
